# WU24 | LIA-Bingo

A small React + Vite web app where students track fun “rookie developer mistakes” during their internship using a randomly generated bingo board. Users can generate their own board, mark completed tiles, and view each other's progress on a shared leaderboard. Built for Web Development class WU24.
